# Learning Data Mining with R
=======
Codes repository for the book {Learning Data Mining with R}
------------

## 1. Where you can find the book?

The book of this project can be found at the site of Packt Publishing Limited

+ [PacktPub](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-data-mining-r)
+ [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781783982103.do) 



## 2. Every algorithm will be provided in five levels of difficulty.<br/>

+ Level 1 is the basic form for reader to understand the algorithm in a straight way.<br/>
+ Level 2 is the beyond form for reader to use in work, in which the algorithm in serialized implementation, based on the ordinary available R packages.<br/>
+ Level 3 is the beyond form for reader to use in work, in which the algorithm in serialized implementation, based on my own contributed R packages to CRAN.<br/>
+ Level 4 is the advanced form for readers to use in work, in which the algorithm in an parallelized implementation, based on the ordinary available R packages and solutions.<br/>
+ Level 5 is the advanced form for readers to use in work, in which the algorithm in an parallelized implementation, based on my own contributed R packages to CRAN.<br/>

the file names for the sorce codes are suffixed with *_basic.R, *_beyond1.R, *_beyond2.R, *_advanced1.R, *_advanced2.R respectively w.r.t. above 5 levels.

## 3. Target for a brand new data mining framework
